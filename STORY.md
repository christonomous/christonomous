# My Journey: From Crypto Startups to Building an Advanced Onchain Trading Bot

I am not just an agentic crypto enthusiast. I am building an onchain trading bot with advanced smart money concepts and orderflow strategies, so you can make money while you sleep.

## My First Crypto Startup

My first crypto startup was **Cunoro Finance**, a **Yield-Generating Reserve** backed by **Active Treasury Arbitrage**. It was technically an [Olympus DAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) Fork but customized to fit our vision. Unfortunately, during the crypto winter of 2022, I couldn't sustain the $74k market cap. But I knew I would have a comeback by building an advanced onchain trading bot.

## Ecosis Network and Learning Experiences

Since then, in 2024/2025, I founded another startup called Ecosis Network (now Autonomous Enterprises, but in stealth mode). This was a DPoS Blockchain where transaction fees get redistributed among users, creating a new kind of marketplace where participants get rewarded. Unfortunately, it never gained significant traction, but we participated in the Blockchain Founders Group acceleration program, though the investors finally did not invest in us. During this period, I connected with amazing people and learned a lot about business.

While working on **ecosis Network**, I had the pleasure of getting promoted by the Lisk Berlin Blockchain Center on how such platforms could be used for artists. Here's a YouTube video showcasing that: [https://youtu.be/vn4Z-F8iuWg?si=WaicBD1wBexoNtUN](https://youtu.be/vn4Z-F8iuWg?si=WaicBD1wBexoNtUN).

## Jumping on the AI Wave

I learned a lot from these experiences. In 2024, I jumped on the AI wave and founded an AI Automation Agency called Revoro Consulting (formerly Brane Media). I built marketing funnel automations, chatbots, and more for companies like KüchenDesk, Twist Media Group and more. I also became an advisor for the Startup Starhot Money building a DeFi app. Through this, I learned extensively about AI development, prompt engineering, and automating processes.

One of my first experiences building automations was for Heckmann Anwaltskanzleia long time, automating a filesystem for a lawyer firm to reduce manual work.

## Returning to My True Passion

That was all much fun, but I knew my long-term goal was still the trading bot. I wanted a comeback into crypto with everything I had learned. During the agency period, I learned a lot about trading at night - every night, a bit at a time.

2024/2025 has been a gold mine, but by summer 2025, small agencies like mine became obsolete since AI automation can now be done by any SaaS. I knew I didn't want to do half-measures anymore. I wanted to come back and go all-in into crypto and trading.

## Building the Dream

So, I stopped focusing on my agency and started developing strategies with everything I knew. I stress-tested them with paper trading on TradingView and built my bot at night. I learned a lot about Smart Money (Inner Circle Trading) and Orderflow, played around with a bunch of common algo trading strategies, and I knew I wanted to automate this.

I started trading with prop firm accounts and developed everything from scratch with the goal to start the year 2026 with my trading bot.

So here I am, and I'm looking forward to building towards my dream.
